# MAUD-TBP
MAUD toolset for batch processing

## Summary
The objective of this project is to provide an interface to enable batch processing of diffraction experiments that are processed with reitveld analysis program MAUD.

This repository contains scripts that interface with data from the neutron time of flight instrument HIPPO at LANSCE and MAUD. In addition, these scripts can be utilized for other diffraction analysis in MAUD>
